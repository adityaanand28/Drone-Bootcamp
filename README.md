# Drone Bootcamp

## Details:

This project was offered by Aeromodelling Club, IIT Kanpur during summers from May'21 to Jul'21. The following objective was archieved during the project:
- Simulated the quadcopter and hexacopter on Gazebo to study drone kinematics, dynamics and degree of freedom
- Executed drone simulation using MATLAB and Simulink to run the quadcopter in a virtual mode and ran ROS packages
- Flight Planning was done using Mission Planner to control the quadcopter and studied feedback loop of PID controller
